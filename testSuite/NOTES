Add a test that does a transfer between schedulers

   DONE

and rehabilitate skip-14 into something that uses the entire stack.

    * What was the problem with test 14?  
       (100 threads with a minimal stack.  Just return.)  
      Seems ok at the moment.

      Wait... the problem is that we have to be able to call the
      scheduler and lwp_exit(), so the stack needs to be a little bigger. 
      But how big?

    DONE (I think):  Made the stack all of 40 words.  This should
    be big enough to call lwp_exit(), but still cause problems if
    they're allocating wrongly.      

=====================================================================
Proposed tests:
	 new Given lwp.h
	 new Publish version

	 check that lwp_yield(), start(), and exit() do the right thign
	 if the scheduler returns NULL.

	 try calling lwp_exit() with a scheduler that insists that you
	 run the calling thread
